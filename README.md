# Aarogya ID Assignment

Aarogya ID is a document processing interface that allows users to upload various types of documents (like invoices, reports, and prescriptions), store them with basic metadata (file name, URL, upload date), and eventually extract key-value data from them using Document AI. This is a frontend + backend system built as a full-stack assignment.

## Project Structure

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
Located in the `backend/` directory.

- **Schemas** are used for MongoDB document structure.
- Files are not stored directly — only metadata like file name, URL, upload date (via `timestamp`), and an autogenerated ID are saved.
- Document AI is **not yet integrated**, but planning to support it in the future.

### Frontend (React.js + Framer Motion)
Located in the `client/` directory.

- Users can upload a document file and preview stored documents.
- Responsive UI mimicking reference designs (e.g., SwasthX).
- Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion.
- Displays extracted key-value pairs once Document AI is integrated.
